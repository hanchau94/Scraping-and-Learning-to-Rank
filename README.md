# Web_mining-Project
Welcome to our project, aimed at revolutionizing university customer support with the implementation of a Learning to Rank Chatbot. In today's digital age, universities face increasing demands for efficient and effective support services. Recognizing this challenge, our team has developed a cutting-edge chatbot system that leverages Learning to Rank algorithms to prioritize and deliver personalized responses to user queries. By integrating machine learning techniques with natural language processing, our chatbot learns from user interactions, continuously improving its ability to provide relevant and helpful assistance. This project not only streamlines the support process for students, faculty, and staff but also enhances overall user satisfaction and productivity within the university community. We invite you to explore our codebase.
